# Network Access Setup Guide
**Enable Team Access to Your MCP Web Dashboard**

## üåê Overview

This guide will help you set up network access so your teammates can use the Network Device MCP Dashboard from their computers on your network.

## üîß Step 1: Find Your Computer's IP Address

### Method 1: Command Line
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for your main network adapter's IPv4 address (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)

### Method 2: PowerShell
```powershell
Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object {$_.IPAddress -notlike "127.*" -and $_.IPAddress -notlike "169.*"} | Select-Object IPAddress, InterfaceAlias
```

### Method 3: Windows Settings
1. Open Settings ‚Üí Network & Internet
2. Click "Properties" for your active connection
3. Note the IPv4 address

**Example:** Your IP might be `192.168.1.100`

## üî• Step 2: Configure Windows Firewall

### Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended)
Run this batch file as Administrator:

```cmd
@echo off
echo Configuring Windows Firewall for MCP Dashboard...

REM Allow inbound traffic on port 5000
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MCP Network Dashboard" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000

REM Allow outbound traffic (usually enabled by default)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="MCP Network Dashboard Out" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000

echo Firewall configured successfully!
echo Your team can now access the dashboard at: http://%computername%:5000
echo Or using IP address: http://[YOUR-IP]:5000
pause
```

Save this as `setup-firewall.bat` and run as Administrator.

### Option B: Manual Firewall Setup
1. **Open Windows Defender Firewall**
   - Press Win+R, type `wf.msc`, press Enter

2. **Create Inbound Rule**
   - Click "Inbound Rules" ‚Üí "New Rule"
   - Select "Port" ‚Üí Next
   - Select "TCP" ‚Üí Specific Local Ports: `5000`
   - Select "Allow the connection" ‚Üí Next
   - Check all profiles (Domain, Private, Public) ‚Üí Next
   - Name: "MCP Network Dashboard" ‚Üí Finish

3. **Create Outbound Rule** (if needed)
   - Repeat above steps for "Outbound Rules"

## üöÄ Step 3: Start the Dashboard Server

### For Network Access
Update your `start-web-dashboard.bat` to bind to all network interfaces:

```batch
@echo off
echo Starting MCP Dashboard for Network Access...

call venv\Scripts\activate.bat

REM Set Flask to listen on all network interfaces
set FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
set FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000

python rest_api_server.py

pause
```

### Or Modify `rest_api_server.py`
Ensure the last line uses `host='0.0.0.0'`:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

## üë• Step 4: Share Access with Your Team

### Internal URLs to Share
Replace `[YOUR-IP]` with your actual IP address:

```
Main Dashboard: http://[YOUR-IP]:5000
API Documentation: http://[YOUR-IP]:5000/api
Health Check: http://[YOUR-IP]:5000/health

Examples:
- http://192.168.1.100:5000
- http://10.0.0.50:5000
```

### Create Team Access Document
```markdown
# MCP Dashboard Access

## üåê Web Dashboard
**URL:** http://[YOUR-IP]:5000

## üîç Quick Start
1. Open the URL in any web browser
2. Click "Store Investigation" 
3. Select brand (BWW, Arby's, Sonic)
4. Enter store ID (e.g., 155)
5. Click "Start Investigation"

## üìä Available Features
- Store security analysis
- URL blocking reports  
- FortiManager status
- Real-time monitoring
- Professional reports

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting
- **Page won't load:** Contact IT Admin
- **Connection error:** Server may be offline
- **No data showing:** Check store ID or contact IT

**IT Contact:** [Your Name] - [Your Email/Phone]
```

## üîí Step 5: Security Considerations

### Network Security
```batch
REM Only allow access from your internal network
REM Example: Only allow 192.168.1.x network
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="MCP Network Dashboard" new remoteip=192.168.1.0/24
```

### Access Control Options
1. **IP-based restrictions** (above)
2. **Windows Authentication** (if needed)
3. **VPN-only access** for remote workers
4. **Time-based restrictions** for business hours only

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 6: Advanced Network Setup

### Static IP Assignment
For consistent access, consider setting a static IP:

1. **Open Network Settings**
2. **Change adapter options**
3. **Right-click your network adapter** ‚Üí Properties
4. **Select "Internet Protocol Version 4"** ‚Üí Properties
5. **Choose "Use the following IP address"**
6. **Enter:** IP, Subnet, Gateway, DNS

### Port Forwarding (If Needed)
If your team is on different network segments:

1. **Access your router's admin panel** (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. **Find Port Forwarding settings**
3. **Forward external port 5000 to your computer's IP:5000**
4. **Save and restart router**

## üìä Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Dashboard Status
```cmd
REM Test if dashboard is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000/health

REM Test from network
curl http://[YOUR-IP]:5000/health
```

### Monitor Team Usage
The dashboard shows connection status and can log access:
- Green dot = Server running
- Team members' browsers will show real-time status
- Check server console for access logs

### Automatic Startup (Production)
Create a Windows Service or Scheduled Task:

```cmd
REM Using Task Scheduler
schtasks /create /tn "MCP Dashboard" /tr "C:\path\to\start-web-dashboard.bat" /sc onstart /ru System
```

## üéØ Step 8: Team Training

### Quick Training Checklist
- [ ] Share dashboard URL with team
- [ ] Demo store investigation process
- [ ] Explain security health scores
- [ ] Show where to find exported reports
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting contacts

### Team Capabilities
Once network access is set up, your team can:
‚úÖ Investigate any store across all brands
‚úÖ Monitor security events in real-time
‚úÖ Generate professional reports
‚úÖ Access FortiManager status
‚úÖ No Claude Desktop or technical knowledge required

## üö® Troubleshooting Network Access

### Common Issues

**"Connection Refused" Error:**
```cmd
REM Check if server is running
netstat -an | findstr :5000

REM Check firewall status
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="MCP Network Dashboard"
```

**"Page Not Found" Error:**
- Verify server is running with `0.0.0.0` binding
- Check firewall rules are active
- Confirm IP address is correct

**Slow Response:**
- Check network bandwidth
- Monitor server resource usage
- Consider upgrading hardware if needed

**Team Can't Access:**
- Verify they're on the same network
- Check their firewall/antivirus settings
- Test with `ping [YOUR-IP]` first
